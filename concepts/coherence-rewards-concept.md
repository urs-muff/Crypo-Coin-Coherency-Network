# Coherence Rewards (COH003)

## Summary
Coherence Rewards is an economic mechanism within the Crypto Coin Coherency Network that rewards actions and contributions that increase overall coherence in the network.

## Detailed Description

### Core Features
- Incentivizes actions that align with network principles and goals
- Utilizes multiple metrics to assess the value and impact of contributions
- Integrates with [One Coin (CC001)](#one-coin-cc001) for reward distribution

### Functionality
1. **Reward Metrics**:
   - Alignment with Principles: Measures how well actions align with core network principles like [Unity Consciousness (COH001)](#unity-consciousness-coh001)
   - Collaboration Quality: Assesses the degree of [Flow State Collaboration (COH002)](#flow-state-collaboration-coh002) achieved
   - Positive Impact: Evaluates the overall beneficial effect on the network and its goals

2. **Assessment Mechanism**:
   - Utilizes [Multidimensional Impact Assessment (COH007)](#multidimensional-impact-assessment-coh007) to evaluate contributions
   - Incorporates peer reviews and network-wide feedback

3. **Reward Distribution**:
   - Automatically distributes [One Coin (CC001)](#one-coin-cc001) rewards based on coherence scores
   - Implements [Smart Contracts (CC002)](#smart-contracts-cc002) for transparent and efficient reward allocation

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Provides detailed feedback to contributors on their coherence scores
   - Suggests areas for improvement and potential collaborations to increase coherence

### Potential Developments
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy and fairness of coherence assessments
- Creation of a reputation system based on long-term coherence contributions
- Development of specialized coherence reward pools for specific network initiatives or challenges

### Open Questions
1. How can the reward system ensure a fair balance between different types of contributions (e.g., creative, technical, administrative)?
2. What measures can be put in place to prevent gaming or manipulation of the coherence reward system?
3. How should the network handle conflicts between short-term coherence gains and long-term network health?
4. How can the coherence reward system adapt to evolving network needs and global challenges?
