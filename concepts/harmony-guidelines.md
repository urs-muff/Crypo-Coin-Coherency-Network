# Harmony Guidelines

## Summary
Harmony Guidelines are the collectively agreed-upon principles, practices, and rules that govern the operations and interactions within the Crypto Coin Coherency Network, promoting balance, coherence, and synergy.

## Detailed Description
Harmony Guidelines are special instances of Seeds that embody the current state of collective agreement on how the network should function. They represent the evolving wisdom of the community, providing a framework for behavior, decision-making, and conflict resolution. These guidelines are not rigid rules, but rather flexible principles that adapt as the network grows and evolves through the proposal process.
