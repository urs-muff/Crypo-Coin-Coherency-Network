# Synergy Links and Interactions (CC005)

## Summary
Concept links create connections between different ideas and content pieces, forming a web of interrelated information and interactions.

## Detailed Description

### Core Features
- Links have timestamps and optional update/transformation policies
- Policies can include registered and confirmed content translators
- Interactions can have restrictions, such as concept emojis with percentage allocations
- Members can subscribe to concept changes
- Concept changes can be contributions, either external (wrapped with a confirmed network verifier) or uploaded

### Functionality
1. **Timestamped Links**:
   - Each link between concepts includes a timestamp
   - Allows for tracking the evolution of concept relationships over time
   - Integrates with [Transaction Properties (CC003)](#transaction-properties-cc003) for comprehensive data tracking

2. **Update/Transformation Policies**:
   - Links can have policies governing how they update or transform
   - May include registered and confirmed content translators for dynamic link content
   - Policies can be enforced through [Smart Contracts (CC002)](#smart-contracts-cc002)

3. **Interaction Restrictions**:
   - Concept interactions can be restricted or guided using various mechanisms
   - Example: Using concept emojis with percentage allocations to categorize or weight interactions
   - Restrictions can be managed through [Network Governance (CC008)](#network-governance-cc008)

4. **Change Subscriptions**:
   - Members can subscribe to receive notifications about concept changes
   - Keeps interested parties informed about evolving ideas and content
   - Enhances [Member Interactions (CC007)](#member-interactions-cc007) with the [Concept System (CC004)](#concept-system-cc004)

5. **Contribution Mechanisms**:
   - Concepts can be changed through various types of contributions
   - External contributions can be wrapped with a confirmed network verifier
   - Direct uploads to the network are also supported
   - Contributions can be valued and traded in the [Marketplace (CC006)](#marketplace-cc006)

### Potential Developments
- Creation of a visual interface for exploring and navigating concept links
- Development of AI-powered content translators for automatic link updates
- Implementation of a gamification system for encouraging valuable concept interactions
- Integration of [One Coin (CC001)](#one-coin-cc001) for monetizing high-value concept links and interactions

### Open Questions
1. How will the system balance the complexity of link policies with user-friendliness?
2. What criteria will be used to confirm network verifiers for external contributions?
3. How can the concept link system be leveraged to create new forms of collaborative content creation?
4. How will the value of concept links and interactions be determined and reflected in the network's economy?
