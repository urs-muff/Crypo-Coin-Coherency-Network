# Concept Links and Interactions

## Summary
Concept links create connections between different ideas and content pieces, forming a web of interrelated information and interactions.

## Detailed Description

### Core Features
- Links have timestamps and optional update/transformation policies
- Policies can include registered and confirmed content translators
- Interactions can have restrictions, such as concept emojis with percentage allocations
- Members can subscribe to concept changes
- Concept changes can be contributions, either external (wrapped with a confirmed network verifier) or uploaded

### Functionality
1. **Timestamped Links**:
   - Each link between concepts includes a timestamp
   - Allows for tracking the evolution of concept relationships over time

2. **Update/Transformation Policies**:
   - Links can have policies governing how they update or transform
   - May include registered and confirmed content translators for dynamic link content

3. **Interaction Restrictions**:
   - Concept interactions can be restricted or guided using various mechanisms
   - Example: Using concept emojis with percentage allocations to categorize or weight interactions

4. **Change Subscriptions**:
   - Members can subscribe to receive notifications about concept changes
   - Keeps interested parties informed about evolving ideas and content

5. **Contribution Mechanisms**:
   - Concepts can be changed through various types of contributions
   - External contributions can be wrapped with a confirmed network verifier
   - Direct uploads to the network are also supported

### Potential Developments
- Creation of a visual interface for exploring and navigating concept links
- Development of AI-powered content translators for automatic link updates
- Implementation of a gamification system for encouraging valuable concept interactions

### Open Questions
1. How will the system balance the complexity of link policies with user-friendliness?
2. What criteria will be used to confirm network verifiers for external contributions?
3. How can the concept link system be leveraged to create new forms of collaborative content creation?
