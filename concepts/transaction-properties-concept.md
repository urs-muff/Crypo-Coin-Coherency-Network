### Functionality
1. **Multi-party Value Distribution**:
   - Allows for complex transactions involving multiple sellers and buyers
   - Each party can be assigned a percentage of the full transaction value
   - Utilizes [One Coin (CC001)](#one-coin-cc001) for value representation and transfer

2. **Transparency**:

3. **Concept Linking**:
   - Transactions can be linked to both public and private concepts
   - Creates a web of interconnected transactions and ideas

4. **Asset Management**:
   - Free uploads with size limits
   - Option for coin wrapping for larger assets
   - Facilitates content management within the [Concept System (CC004)](#concept-system-cc004)

### Potential Developments
- Development of advanced analytics tools for tracking and visualizing transaction networks
- Creation of customizable privacy settings for different types of transactions
- Integration with the concept system for automatic value distribution based on concept ownership
- Implementation of [Smart Contracts (CC002)](#smart-contracts-cc002) for automated handling of complex transaction properties
