# Proposal

## Summary
A Proposal is a formal suggestion for change or action within the Crypto Coin Coherency Network, presented for collective consideration and decision-making.

## Detailed Description
Proposals are special instances of Seeds that embody the collective wisdom process. They represent ideas, changes, or initiatives that could potentially alter or enhance the network's functioning, rules, or direction. Each Proposal goes through a lifecycle of creation, discussion, voting, and potentially implementation, serving as a key mechanism for decentralized governance and evolution of the network.

### Core Features
- Initiated by Synergy Nodes (stewards) to suggest changes or new ideas
- Contains a clear title, detailed description, and rationale for the proposed change
- Includes a voting mechanism for other Synergy Nodes to express their stance
- Has a defined lifecycle (e.g., draft, active, passed, rejected, implemented)
- May link to relevant Concepts, Seeds, or other network elements

### Functionality
- Facilitates structured decision-making within the network
- Allows for community input and collective agreement on changes
- Serves as a historical record of network evolution and decision-making processes
- Can trigger automatic actions or changes in the network if passed and implemented

### Potential Developments
- Integration with smart contracts for automatic execution of passed proposals
- Advanced voting mechanisms (e.g., quadratic voting, delegation)
- Proposal templates for common types of suggestions or changes
