# Coherence Web (CC004)

## Summary
The concept system is a core feature of the network, allowing for the creation, ownership, and monetization of ideas and content.

## Detailed Description

### Core Features
- Each concept has a public interface
- Can be interacted with like various social media platforms (Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
- Concepts can be owned by multiple members with percentage stakes
- Changes to concepts may require network approval
- Concepts can be interactive endpoints contributed to and approved by the network

### Functionality
1. **Public Interface**:
   - Every concept is accessible through a standardized public interface
   - Allows for consistent interaction across different types of concepts
   - Facilitates integration with [Concept Links and Interactions (CC005)](#concept-links-and-interactions-cc005)

2. **Multi-platform Interaction**:
   - Concepts can be interacted with in ways similar to popular social media and content platforms
   - Provides familiar user experiences while introducing novel ownership and monetization models
   - Enhances [Member Interactions (CC007)](#member-interactions-cc007) within the network

3. **Shared Ownership**:
   - Concepts can have multiple owners with defined percentage stakes
   - Allows for collaborative creation and shared benefits
   - Ownership stakes can be traded in the [Marketplace (CC006)](#marketplace-cc006)

4. **Network Governance**:
   - Significant changes to concepts may require approval from the network
   - Ensures quality control and community consensus
   - Aligns with overall [Network Governance (CC008)](#network-governance-cc008) principles

5. **Interactive Endpoints**:
   - Concepts can serve as interactive endpoints within the network
   - Allows for the creation of dynamic, functional concepts beyond static content
   - Can be integrated with [Smart Contracts (CC002)](#smart-contracts-cc002) for automated interactions

### Potential Developments
- Development of a concept creation and editing tool with built-in collaboration features
- Implementation of a reputation system for concept contributors and owners
- Creation of concept marketplaces for buying, selling, and trading concept stakes
- Integration of [One Coin (CC001)](#one-coin-cc001) for concept valuation and transactions

### Open Questions
1. How will the network determine which changes to concepts require approval?
2. What mechanisms will be in place to protect intellectual property within the concept system?
3. How can the system encourage high-quality concept creation and discourage low-effort or spam concepts?
4. How will [Transaction Properties (CC003)](#transaction-properties-cc003) be applied to concept-related transactions?
