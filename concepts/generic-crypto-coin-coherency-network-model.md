# Generic Crypto Coin Coherency Network Model

This model uses the most generic concepts possible, allowing for maximum flexibility in implementation across different programming paradigms and languages.

## Core Generic Structures

```
struct Node {
    id: Identifier
    type: String
    properties: Map<String, Value>
    relations: List<Edge>
}

struct Edge {
    source: Identifier
    target: Identifier
    type: String
    properties: Map<String, Value>
}

struct Value {
    type: String
    content: Any
}

struct Identifier {
    value: String
}

struct Action {
    type: String
    parameters: Map<String, Value>
    result: Value
}

struct Constraint {
    condition: Expression
    message: String
}

struct Expression {
    type: String
    content: Any
}

struct Event {
    type: String
    timestamp: Value  // Represents a point in time
    properties: Map<String, Value>
}
```

Now, let's apply this generic structure to our concepts:

## Concept (Generic for all CC00X)

```
Node {
    id: Identifier { value: "CC00X" }
    type: "Concept"
    properties: {
        "name": Value { type: "String", content: "Concept Name" },
        "summary": Value { type: "String", content: "Concept Summary" },
        "description": Value { type: "String", content: "Detailed description of the concept" }
    }
    relations: [
        Edge {
            source: Identifier { value: "CC00X" },
            target: Identifier { value: "User123" },
            type: "ContributedBy",
            properties: {}
        },
        Edge {
            source: Identifier { value: "CC00X" },
            target: Identifier { value: "Asset456" },
            type: "HasAsset",
            properties: {}
        }
    ]
}
```

## Actions (Generic for all concept operations)

```
Action {
    type: "CreateConcept"
    parameters: {
        "creator": Value { type: "Identifier", content: "User123" },
        "content": Value { type: "Any", content: {} }
    }
    result: Value { type: "Identifier", content: "NewConceptId" }
}

Action {
    type: "LinkConcepts"
    parameters: {
        "source": Value { type: "Identifier", content: "ConceptA" },
        "target": Value { type: "Identifier", content: "ConceptB" },
        "linkType": Value { type: "String", content: "RelatedTo" }
    }
    result: Value { type: "Identifier", content: "NewLinkId" }
}

Action {
    type: "ExecuteTransaction"
    parameters: {
        "parties": Value { type: "List", content: ["UserA", "UserB"] },
        "amount": Value { type: "Number", content: 100 },
        "currency": Value { type: "String", content: "OneCoin" }
    }
    result: Value { type: "Identifier", content: "TransactionId" }
}
```

## Constraints (Generic for all concepts)

```
Constraint {
    condition: Expression {
        type: "BooleanExpression",
        content: "node.properties['value'] > 0"
    }
    message: "Value must be positive"
}

Constraint {
    condition: Expression {
        type: "BooleanExpression",
        content: "edge.properties['percentage'] <= 100"
    }
    message: "Percentage cannot exceed 100"
}
```

## Events (Generic for all system events)

```
Event {
    type: "ConceptCreated"
    timestamp: Value { type: "DateTime", content: "2024-06-22T10:30:00Z" }
    properties: {
        "conceptId": Value { type: "Identifier", content: "NewConceptId" },
        "creator": Value { type: "Identifier", content: "User123" }
    }
}

Event {
    type: "TransactionExecuted"
    timestamp: Value { type: "DateTime", content: "2024-06-22T11:45:00Z" }
    properties: {
        "transactionId": Value { type: "Identifier", content: "Tx789" },
        "amount": Value { type: "Number", content: 50 },
        "currency": Value { type: "String", content: "OneCoin" }
    }
}
```

This generic model provides a flexible foundation for implementing the Crypto Coin Coherency Network. Here's how it maps to the original concepts:

1. One Coin (CC001): Can be represented as a Node with specific properties and relations to transactions and users.
2. Smart Contracts (CC002): Can be implemented as a series of Actions and Constraints on Nodes and Edges.
3. Transaction Properties (CC003): Can be modeled as Edges between User Nodes, with properties defining the transaction details.
4. Concept System (CC004): The core of this model, where each concept is a Node with various properties and relations.
5. Concept Links and Interactions (CC005): Represented by Edges between concept Nodes, with Actions defining the interaction methods.
6. Marketplace (CC006): Can be implemented as a collection of Nodes (listings) and Actions (buy, sell), with Edges representing transactions.
7. Member Interactions (CC007): Modeled through Actions and Events involving User Nodes.
8. Network Governance (CC008): Implemented through Constraints and special Actions that modify the system's rules.

This generic model allows for:
- Flexible implementation in various programming paradigms (object-oriented, functional, etc.)
- Easy extension by adding new Node types, Edge types, Actions, or Events
- Clear separation of data (Nodes and Edges) from behavior (Actions) and rules (Constraints)
- Event-driven architecture through the use of the Event structure
- Complex querying and traversal of the concept graph using the generic Node and Edge structures
