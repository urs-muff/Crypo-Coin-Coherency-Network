# Smart Contracts

## Summary
Smart contracts in this network act as transaction restrictors and executors, ensuring that all parties adhere to agreed-upon terms.

## Detailed Description

### Core Features
- Act as restrictions to execute transactions
- Can be executed by network-confirmed handlers
- Define terms and conditions of interactions within the network
- Support complex logic for multi-party transactions

### Functionality
1. **Transaction Restriction**:
   - Set conditions that must be met before a transaction can be executed
   - Ensure compliance with network rules and user agreements

2. **Automated Execution**:
   - Once conditions are met, contracts automatically execute
   - Reduces need for intermediaries and increases efficiency

3. **Multi-party Support**:
   - Can manage transactions involving multiple sellers, buyers, or other parties
   - Distribute funds or resources according to predefined percentages or conditions

4. **Network-confirmed Handlers**:
   - Specialized entities or algorithms approved by the network to execute contracts
   - Ensure security and proper execution of complex contract logic

### Potential Developments
- Creation of a library of template contracts for common transaction types
- Integration of oracle services for external data inputs
- Development of a user-friendly interface for creating and managing smart contracts

### Open Questions
1. How will the network validate and approve handlers for executing contracts?
2. What dispute resolution mechanisms will be in place for smart contract disagreements?
3. How can the system ensure transparency while maintaining necessary privacy in contract execution?
